**Introduction:**

This is a new idea about creating a program which is used to simplify English translation. The project is make a program which can help us translate English unfamiliar words more easily.

**Functions:**

1.You can enter a English word, then the program will return relative Chinese information about this word and save it in a txt file.

2.At the next time, when you run this program, it will initialize itself by that txt file, and then you can use it as usual.

3.I have other ideas about this project, for example, we can add a function which can test our demand of these English words.

**Project state:**
I have already finished basic functions of this project, including transform between Chinses and English, and it also saves this "word-meaning" pairs in different files.

The repertory has a folder named EngWordsTrans now, and you can find some files in it, Here are descriptions of each file:

1.EngWordsTrans.py      source file

2.EngWordsTrans.exe     executable file which is made by pyinstaller

3.ReadMe.md             a markdown document which is used to explain some information about this project.

This project is made by python mainly, and it more like a reptile, because I use youdao.com to collect information about target word and implement this program, which means if you don't link to Internet, the program can do nothing. The functions of the program are most basically, and I will add more details and functions into it later if I have spare time and more interests in it.

(I'm using this program to write the ReadMe document, and I find it make my work more convenice!)

**Description:**

I'm a Chinese and my English is not very good, so when I use GitHub and Sublime Text3, I always meet some unfamiliar words and don't know their meanings. Although using translation websites such as baidu and youdao by browser is convenient, I think I can use a program to make it easier and more convenient, then when I need to translate a word, I don't need to open a browser page and enter a website url, I just need to open my program and enter the word. At the meantime, it's also unnecessary for me to save these words and their meanings by hand, the program save them in a document automatically. I think the program will help me work more efficiently, and if I have spare time, I will set about coding and implementing this program.
